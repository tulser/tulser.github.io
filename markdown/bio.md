I'm an aspiring programmer with a passion for graphics and real-time systems and other fields which supplement my hobbies. I'm also very fond of Linux, particularly Debian-based systems, of which I base most of my development on and use as daily drivers. Specifically within the domain of Linux, I enjoy creating and contributing to desktop applications and the desktop experience in general.

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/tulser) for public repositories or my listed [projects](/projects) on this site for past or present projects of mine.

**I am open to work.**

If interested in potentially hiring me for a software development or IT role (or related work otherwise), you can message me at my professional email address, [`self@wcyates.xyz`](mailto:self@wcyates.xyz).

## Interests

I am particularly dedicated to daily driving Debian systems. To me, Debian is a community driven, but longstanding distribution backed by a similarly characterized yet also mature project which has proven to me to be robust and stable, even when using the unstable distribution. In the Debian project, I have aspirations to get involved in the Debian processes and packaging after having created a few source packages.

I currently have a custom built desktop suitable for gaming and HPC, which purely runs Debian, and a laptop, which multiboots Debian, Windows, and Cachy-OS. Additionally, for my experimentation, I occasionally use and test NixOS, OpenSUSE [Tumbleweed], and Debian VMs in QEMU.

I'm most proficient in C, Python, and C-like languages, namely C++, Zig, and Rust while having some experience in Javascript, Typescript, and CSS.

### Hobbies

I enjoy the visual arts, including creating graphics and artworks in my spare time. Currently, I sometimes publish my artworks under a pseudonym, which I wish to keep private, outside of known and trusted circles.

I'm also very interested in anthropology as it applies to the present or the future. Specifically, I am intrigued by the expectations people have of others and the way we organize social standards in our systems, including from that of culture, values, politics/governance, etcetera.

Stemming in part from my anthropological intrigues, I enjoy writing and worldbuilding that is specualtive in nature. I often develop and write fictions/universes in my spare time, of which I sometimes think about potential technologies or movements as well as their applications and impacts in the future, specifically extending up to a lifetime or century from now. Additionally, I am particularly interested in generalizing anthropology to a study of greater systems beyond humanity and human cultures; this study may have applications and merits beyond my fictions. Currently, I don't publish my writing except for private drafts. The subject of my writing often is connected with my publications of artworks, so it is of course discussed privately or pseudonymously.

If you come to know me personally, you can feel free to ask about my ventures and works. I personally use the free and open source Krita and Libreoffice for their respective, trivially assumable uses; however, seeing some inadequacies, I have been looking at upstarting several software to supersede this longstanding suite of programs.

Additionally, I like volunteering and working for non-profits and local organizations.
As a Boy Scout, I had helped with numerous community service projects around my area with my troop members and did my own project before the cusp of achieving the respected and ultimate rank of Eagle Scout.
For the past few months, I have been volunteering at a local animal shelter, handling dogs of all kinds for a few hours each week while working on my personal projects and ventures.
