I'm an aspiring programmer with a passion for graphics and real-time systems. I'm also very fond of Linux, particularly Debian-based systems, and I also enjoy creating and contributing to desktop applications and the desktop experience in general.

As of now, I'm currently working on several projects, in part to bolster my portfolio. See my [GitHub](https://github.com/tulser) or my listed [projects](/projects) on this site for existing, public work of mine. Some original projects may be unpublished.

## Other Interests
I enjoy the visual arts, including creating graphics and artworks in my spare time. Many of my artworks are not published under my name, but there may be my own vector graphics associated with my projects.

I'm also very interested in anthropology as it applies to the present or future. Generally, I am intrigued by the expectations people have of others and the way we organize social standards in our systems, including from that of culture, values, politics/governance, etcetera.

Somewhat stemming from my interests society and culture, I often write fictions in my spare time. Most are speculative or sci-fi, all are unpublished or unadapted at the moment. I sometimes think about potential future technologies or movements as well as their applications and impacts.
