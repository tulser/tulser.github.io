I'm an aspiring programmer from the DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) area with a passion for graphics and real-time systems.

## Interests
I enjoy the visual arts, creating graphics and artworks for different purposes in my spare time. Not much for art is, or will be, here on this site; if you want to see anything and you know me, just ask!

I'm also very interested in many facets of culture, the nature of people, and of morality and doctrine. So much so that I often incorporate these interests into the fiction and worldbuilding I write in my spare time. I also enjoy speculating on the future of civilization, including advances in technology, potential cultural movements, and their impact on society.

## Blog
The [blog](/blog) might have a few thoughts in articles, if I ever get to making it. I (presumably will) post about anything mentioned above.
